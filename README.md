# the_matrix

the_matrix simulates and renders  3d fractalized voxel worlds that can be filled with objects. Each object in the matrix has the ability to specify how its own internal matrix (interal voxel world) is arranged. This means that many objects in a matrix may have both an external rendering and an internal rendering that can be switched by walking in an out of the object much like you would a house.
